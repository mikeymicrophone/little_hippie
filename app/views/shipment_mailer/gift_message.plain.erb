Exciting news! Someone who loves you has just ordered you a gift from LittleHippie.com. Our warehouse does not have the ability to include gift notes with packages, so we wanted to send your gift note by email.

<%= @customer.name %> says:

<%= @cart.gift_note %>

Your tracking number is <%= @cart.tracking_number %> and it can be tracked at https://www.ups-mi.net/packageid/.

We hope you love it, but if you need to exchange it, please don't hesitate to contact us at customerservice@littlehippie.com.
